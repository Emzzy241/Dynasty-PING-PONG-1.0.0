## Description
_A  Ping-Pong Game made with C#. Here is an interesting one, in this game user is prompted to enter a value; then my Game lists out all number less than or equal to my user's value. If any of those numbers listed out can be divided by 3 they get a Ping, if any of those numbers listed out  can be divided by a 5, they get a Pong.... And wait there's more, if any of those numbers listed out can be divided by a 3 and a 5, they get a Ping and a Pong_

* Still in the Git bash Terminal, run the command: dotnet build --- THis builds THe Projecta and adds the essential directories to execute the application
* After building the application, Now its time to run the command: dotnet run --- And still in the Git Bash Terminal, you get to see all of tthe results outputted into the console
